# BE Information Technology - Semester 7 Resources ✨

> Top-notch quality resources for the 7th semester !! 👌

Yes, I am aware of your joy at finding this repository. But before using the repository, keep in mind that choosing the correct elective course was the focus of Semester 7. If you don't know anything about this semester, look over the syllabus because there are only 2 required subjects for us, and the remaining 3 are electives. One of these is the Institute Level Elective, which is simply the requirement that the entire institute (yes, all departments) select one elective course among the other options. The majority of students will choose the subject, so make sure what all elective subjects you are choosing.

📝 **Another point to note, as your placement season has started. Just a suggestion, choose those elective subjects which are interesting and easy to clear the IA Tests and the End-Semester exam.** 

For this repository, I have given the resources which includes Assignments, Experiments, and PDFs of Books for the exams. 

## Subjects which we had and I have chosen are:

✅ AIDS (Artifical Intelligence and Data Science) - II\
