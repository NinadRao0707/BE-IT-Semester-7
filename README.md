# BE Information Technology - Semester 7 Resources ✨

> Top-notch quality resources for the 7th semester !! 👌

Yes, I know you are happy after seeing this repository. But before using this, please do note that Semester 7 was all about choosing the right elective subject. If you don't know anything about this semester, then go through the syllabus as there are only 2 subjects which are given to us and the rest 3 subjects are elective subjects. One of them includes the Institute Level Elective, which is nothing but the whole institute (yes, all the departments) has to choose one elective subject among the rest. The subject will be chosen by the majority of the students, so be careful while choosing all the electives.

📝 **Another point to note, as your placement season has started. Just a suggestion, choose those elective subjects which are interesting and easy to clear the IA Tests and the End-Semester exam.** 

For this repository, I have given the resources which includes Assignments, Experiments, and PDFs of Books for the exams. 

## Subjects which we had and I have chosen are:

✅ AIDS (Artifical Intelligence and Data Science) - II\
